Sticky To-Do!üìù

Project Overview
This is a simple To-Do list application that I created as a beginner project. It‚Äôs built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and is designed to help you manage your tasks in a clean and visually appealing way.

Features
Add Tasks: Enter a new task in the input field and click "ADD++" to add it to your to-do list.

Mark as Completed: Click on a task to toggle its completion status. Completed tasks will be crossed out.

Delete Tasks: Remove tasks from the list by clicking the "√ó" next to them.

Persistent Storage: Tasks are saved in your browser‚Äôs local storage, so your to-do list persists even if you refresh the page.

How to Use
Add a Task: Type a task into the input field and click the "ADD++" button.
Complete a Task: Click on a task to mark it as completed or incomplete.
Delete a Task: Click the "√ó" button next to any task to remove it from the list.

About
I'm currently learning JavaScript and love making web apps or tools that others can use and benefit from. I wanted to create a functional and stylish to-do app to practice my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills. This project is a great way for me to apply what I‚Äôve learned and build something useful.

Feel free to provide feedback. I‚Äôm always looking for ways to improve and learn more!
